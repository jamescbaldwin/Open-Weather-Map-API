# Weather Dashboard
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

In the accompanying files, 3 different APIs are used from Open Weather Map that allows a user to search for cities, and have the current conditions for tht city displayed on the page, as well as a 5-day forecast. Furthermore, the user's search history will be displayed, as each previously-searched city will appear and have a 'clickability' function as if the city were being searched for again.

Below is a screenshot displaying the functionality of the app.
